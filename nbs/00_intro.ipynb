    "## Why is Wandb ?\n",
    "You may know about Tensorboard, which also provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation. However, Wandb goes beyond what TensorBoard offers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to use**: Wandb has a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy to log, visualize, and compare machine learning experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: Wandb provides collaboration tools to enable teams to work together on experiments and share results with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatile**: Wandb integrates with a wide range of machine learning frameworks and libraries, making it a flexible and powerful tool for experiment management.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced visualizations**: Wandb provides advanced visualizations for comparing experiments, including scatter plots, histograms, and 3D plots, which make it easier to understand and interpret results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model analysis**: Wandb provides a range of tools for analyzing model performance, including hyperparameter tuning, model comparison, and feature importance analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model reproducibility**: Wandb makes it easy to store and reproduce experiments, including code, data, and results, ensuring that experiments can be repeated and validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cloud-based**: Wandb is cloud-based, which means that users can access their experiments and results from anywhere and don't have to worry about managing infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **Wandb** is a suitable alternative for Tensorboard"
